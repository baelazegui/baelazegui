- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Benjamin Elazegui. I am a registered Mechanical Engineer in the Philippines and I just found out about Data Science last 2021 and I can say that has sparked a great interest in me.
- ðŸ‘€ I got interested in data science because I love solving problems. I also get to play around data and the process of making something out of seemingly nothing will always feel very rewarding for me.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently taking online courses through Coursera, Udemy, and other resources to learn the fundamental concepts that are used in the data science field and some popular programming languages (Python, SQL, etc.) that will be used in performing data science tasks including machine learning for predictive analytics.   
- ðŸ“« You can reach me through my email, baelazegui@gmail.com and I would be glad to have a conversation about Data Science, careers, and life!
